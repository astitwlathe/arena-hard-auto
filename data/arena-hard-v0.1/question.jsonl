As we all know, for my email to work reliably and not get blocked I need to have an unchanging public IP address. Due to my circumstances I am not able to get a static IP address through my ISP or change ISPs at the moment.\n\nThe solution I have found is to buy a 4G SIM card with a static IP (from an ISP that offers that), which I can then use with a USB dongle. However this 4G connection costs me substantially per MB to use.\n\nBut. Mail is the only server that needs a static IP address. For everything else using my home network connection and updating my DNS records with DDNS would be fine. I have tested this setup previously for other services and it has worked.\n\nSo. I was wondering. Would it in theory be possible to: connect the server to two network interfaces at the same time and route traffic depending on destination port. I.e. all outgoing connections to ports 25, 465, 587, and possibly 993 should be sent through the 4G dongle interface (enx344b50000000) and all other connections sent over eth0. Similarly, the server should listen for incoming connections on the same ports on enx344b50000000 and listen on all other ports (if allowed by ufw) on eth0.\n\nI would then need DNS records from mail.mydomain.tld \u2014> <4g static public IP> and mydomain.tld \u2014> <home public IP> (updated with DDNS, and NAT configured on my home router).\n\nComputers on the internet would then be able to seamlessly connect to these two IP addresses, not \u201crealising\u201d that they are in fact the same machine, as long as requests to mail.mydomain.tld are always on the above mentioned ports.\n\nQuestion: Is this possible? Could it be a robust solution that works the way I hope? Would someone be able to help me set it up?\n\nI have come across a few different guides in my DuckDuckGo-ing, I understand it has to do with setting a mark in iptables and assigning them to a table using ip route. However I haven't managed to get it to work yet, and many of these guides are for VPNs and they all seem to be slightly different to each other. So I thought I would ask about my own specific use case"}]}

Upon receiving this command, the Slave ECU starts generating a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal to heat the coil and begins reading the temperature sensor. The coil, while heating the element, consumes a significant amount of current. Ideally, there should be a direct provision from the hardware to sense the actual current consumption and provide this information to the microcontroller. Based on this information, the microcontroller can decide whether to set an undercurrent fault or not. However, in the existing hardware setup, there is no provision to sense the current. And adding this current sensing hardware into the existing product, will attract additional costs and complexities in further component arrangements of the product.\n\nThe existing solutions may use a current sensor or a shunt resistor to measure the actual current consumption of the coil and compare it with a threshold value. Based on these parameters, the undercurrent detection can be easily done. However, this solution would require additional hardware components, which would increase the cost and complexity of the system. Moreover, the current sensor or the shunt resistor could introduce noise or interference in the PWM signal, affecting the heating performance of the coil.\""}]}

From the get-go, they're granted huge swaths of land in the Treaty of San Stefano (though I believe this is more for Russian gain than Bulgarian). But after the Treaty of Berlin, they take Eastern Rumelia for themselves, resulting in the end of the second League of the Three Emperors.

I enjoyed it a lot, and I think it makes a compelling case. But I am aware that I have read a well-argued polemic rather than the historical last word on the subject. So I'm looking for someone to steelman the case that the conventional narrative is true and that Richard was the murderer.  For those who don't have the time or inclination to read the book, I will summarise Tey's arguments as follows: There were few rumours that Richard had murdered the Princes in his own lifetime. Most or all of these can be attributed to the Tudor sympathiser John Morton, who was rewarded for his loyalty by Henry VII by becoming Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor. Consistent with this, the Bill of Attainder brought by Henry VII against Richard after Bosworth accuses Richard of the usual cruelties and tyrannies but makes no mention of the alleged murders. Henry had possession of the Tower immediately upon his arrival in London. If the princes were missing, there is no possible reason why he would not publicise this fact widely and make political capital out of it. The idea that Richard was a child murderer would be the trump card in his hand. If Richard murdered the Princes, his whole motivation was surely to have prevented any sort of rising in their favour. To get any benefit from the murder, the fact of their deaths would therefore have to be made public, sooner rather than later. It would defeat the point if people didn't know they were dead. There was no reason for Richard to have chosen a cloak-and-dagger method and hid the princes' deaths because sooner or later, he was bound to have to account for their disappearance. He only had to have them suffocated, pretend they had died of a fever, and have the crowds mourn as they lay in state. By contrast, if Henry VII ordered the deaths of the Princes, he would have a clear reason to obfuscate the truth, because after sufficient time had passed he could blame their disappearance on his predecessor. Henry VII had much more of a reason to get rid of the princes than Richard. Under Titulus Regius - the act acknowleding the children's illegitimacy by invalidating the marriage between Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville - the boys were out of the line of succession and of no immediate danger to Richard, who had just been unanimously acclaimed as king by parliament and greeted enthusiastically on progress by the English people, who were relieved to avoid a minority. Even if he was concerned about them being used as a figurehead for rebellion, there were nine other heirs to the house of York, including three males. All of these remained at liberty under Richard's entire reign, and Richard named one of them (Edward Plantagenet) his heir, in preference to his own son. By contrast, it was of great importance to Henry that the boys should not continue to live, because Henry married the boys’ elder sister, Elizabeth, as a way of reconciling Yorkists to his occupation of the throne, and he repealed Titulus Regius so as to make her legitimate. In so doing, he automatically made the two boys heir to the throne before her. Indeed, he made the eldest King of England. Therefore, they had to be disposed of quietly. By contrast to the liberty that the other Yorkist heirs enjoyed under Richard, under Henry they were kept under close arrest until they could be eliminated from the scene, either by execution or sending them abroad. For example, Edward Plantagenet was shut up in the Tower before being executed for allegedly planning to escape. Given that we know it was the settled policy of Henry VII and the Tudors to rid themselves of all surviving Yorkist heirs, it is more natural and obvious to ascribe the deaths of the princes to him than to Richard. Elizabeth Woodville was quickly reconciled with Richard after Titulus Regius deprived her of her titles, and her daughters attended Palace festivities - hardly the behaviour of someone who suspected that the King had killed her sons. By contrast, after Henry VII acceded to the throne, Elizabeth was quietly packed off to a nunnery after eighteen months, where she died five years later, completely sidelined from the political nation."}]}

It includes interviews with Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Henry Kissinger. The second episode focuses on the Bosnian genocide in the 1990s. Several senior American diplomats and military leaders criticise the European response to the genocide as being lackluster because the European nations refused to countenance widespread airstrikes against the Serbs in 1993-4. The European concern was that this would lead to retribution against the UN peacekeeping troops on the ground, but some of the American policymakers claim that this was in fact ambivalence and was due to European nations (in particular France and Britain) not caring about the people of Bosnia because they were Muslim. For instance, Alexander Vershbow (Executive Director for European Affairs on the National Security Council) says `The European nations were reluctant to really go to bat for a Muslim population. There may have been an ethnic nationalism which at least contributed to European reluctance to help the Bosnians.` This claim of ambivalence seems to me an extraordinary claim to come from American policymakers. My understanding is that at this time European nations had troops on the ground in Bosnia as part of the UN peacekeeping mandate, and that they were actively taking casualties. By contrast, the US had deemed it politically unacceptable to contribute ground troops to the UN peacekeeping force. It seems highly unreasonable for a country which refused to put its own troops in harms way to then criticise those who did for not supporting a policy which would lead to those troops facing greater danger. Is this claim as unreasonable as it seems, or am I missing something?"}]}

After doing a lot of research for code compliance etc, I determined that a top rail is necessary but a bottom rail is not so we will not be using a bottom rail.

(see images) – aluminum siding was secured directly on top of the foam insulation. Questions: should i replace the existing foam with new foam panels? If so, what material? Should the seams be taped?

This leads to a situation where you have three options: One, saying `yes` and definitely get denied (if it is all digital) Two, saying `no` and risk getting denied for `lying`, especially in countries that the US shares records with, even if it isn't technically a lie, just a misunderstanding. Or three, spend extra money and time getting a full visa with interviews, etc. How would I go about answering conviction/criminal records questions on ETA or arrival cards if I don't remember when and where all of my speeding/traffic tickets were?"}]}

I had asked for time off of work last Friday (08/09/2024), to attend the funeral of my FIL which occured on (08/12/2024). I worked until 12PM that day and then left to attend the funeral, everything seemed fine before I left (aside from grouchy attitude from both NPs). I worked 8-5PM the next day (08/13/2024), then on Wednesday (08/14/2024) while working on collecting notes for a Prior Authorization for Ozempic on a patient I had noticed when they were seen on (08/12/2024) I came across part of the note that stated I had administered an intramuscular (IM) injection to said patient. This patient was seen 4+ hours after I had left the office. I was so confused, shocked, and stunned at that note I had no idea what to do with it and left it be to gather myself. I went through the charts the NPs had accessed and I went through each of them to verify what I had seen, between the 2 NPs that run the clinic I found 5 charts between them that had my name written out as if I was there to have given IM injections, another one failed to document the fact a patient had received IM injection(s) but was written into the superbill. I have already submitted a formal complaint on this matter, but it doesn't quite end there. When I had sent a text to the receptionist on that Monday night (08/12/2024) asking her how the day went she explained to me it was incredibly busy, so much so the 2 NPs made her start giving IM injections and performing swabs (like COVID/Strep/Flu tests), along with an EMT who is friends with said NPs that was enlisted to assist. I've already sought some council with some experienced nurses I know, I've went ahead and filed the formal complaint with state boards, and I have intentions to speak with the clinic CPA to verify my days off where I was not present within the clinic. I fully intend on speaking with a lawyer about this but as of this post (08/17/2024) it's Saturday and all the offices are closed that are nearest to me. I also want to know which ones would be best to speak with, malpractice? Medicare & Medicaid specialty? Business?

I was told before her passing that I would be entitled to a cut of the money from the sale of her house, and now, going over her will, we discovered that she has put conditions for me and the grandchildren to get the money, only getting parts of the money for each condition met. My issue, is that the conditions seem strange and unenforceable. The first condition is that I must read a set religious books as well as the bible (she was aware that that would conflict with my religious beliefs) within a 8 week time period (Not sure how the time limit works, as there's no concrete deadline. It only vaguely says 8 weeks) , but I don't understand how this could be enforced? How could they possibly verify I read anything and didn't just read summaries? What if I don't have the time to do it? I'll do it if it's the only way I can receive the money,but it just doesn't seem like an enforceable condition to me, especially demanding that I read books which I am religiously opposed to. The second and more concerning condition is that she demands that 10% of of my inheritance needs to go towards tithing. The wording is vague as to where exactly the money needs to be tithed, but the implication is that it would go to a church, which I have big ethical issues with. Can it be donated over time to amount to 10%? Do I have to take a 10% cut and give to a church as soon as i receive the money? Is it even enforceable to demand I donate the money after it is in my possession? Wouldn't she have to have committed that money to charity in the will directly and not direct the beneficiaries to donate that money to a church? Is this legal? Thank you in advance for the help. This whole experience has been confusing and stressful. I am California based, if that changes the legality around this at all."}]}

Our neighbors were about half retirees, half middle-aged single adults in their late 30's and 40's, and one or two families with one or two minor children. We both attended high-school and college in the area, and I lived there, at least while not living on campus or out of state, until I got married at 28. My wife and I rented an apartment from a large 100-unit apartment complex that just happened to be located directly across the street from our small condo complex, and so we continued to visit the condo, either to host larger parties, work out of the larger garage if necessary, or to spend time with family. Five years ago my wife and I started having kids, of which we now have three, ranging from 1 month old to 5 years old. After the second kid our small apartment was getting cramped, and my mother was getting remarried, so we decided to buy the condo from her last year. Not only was it more affordable because it was a condo, but I've lived here since I was a kid and I've personally handled nearly all of the tens of thousands in maintenance costs over the years, due to my work as a contractor, so it's already been modified to our preferences. A few months after my mother moved out, we got notice that the board of our 16-unit HOA received a request to convert to an over 55 community and that they were running it by their attorney. I had never heard of this before, but it appears that it's legal to convert if at least 80% of the units have a resident over age 55. With some basic online sleuthing, I was able to determine that due to the younger 30 and 40-something owners moving out or selling over the last 5-10 years, we are now the only unit out of 16 with owners under age 55 (my wife and I both turn 40 next year). We believe the board here was waiting to enact this change as three of the owners are exactly 55 and they would need to have waited for them to cross the 55-year-old threshold in order to move ahead with qualifying for this. Despite the owners ages, two owners presently have children. One has a 24 year old adult daughter, and one has a 10 year old minor kid. At least 3-4 owners are in their 80's and 90's. Anyway, long story short, we received a second notice that they meet all the legal requirements and the HUD survey, and are going to go ahead and vote on this change. They won't tell us who initiated this change, or even why, instead telling us that we can submit our concerns in writing and the HOA attorney will reply. No owners meeting will be held, only a board vote, and all board members are 60-80 years old with no kids. Since we're the only owners under 55 we believe it is almost certain to pass. We filed a long list of concerns with the board including our view that even if we're allowed to remain living here, it will noticeably reduce the property and resell value, our kids may not be allowed to host birthday parties or have friends over anymore, and most importantly, may not be allowed to play in the front or back yards, or anywhere outside our walls, which are all technically common areas. The yards here are un-partitioned and stretch for roughly 100 yards, undivided, behind and in front of the units. My brother and I must have played in these yards with our friends thousands of times over the years. Unfortunately as the years have gone by and our neighbors have moved out and been replaced by older residents, we've gradually received more complaints about noise, parking, and most recently, our new 58 year old neighbor this summer came running out of her house screaming at us and our kids because she said they had touched her flowers and if they did it again she was going to `beat their ass`. That being said, I believe in all honesty that we are as a whole generally quieter and more well-behaved than the average family of five. My kids keep to themselves and mostly stay directly behind or in front of our own unit, with minimal screaming. We both work from home and have monitored them all day at times to verify this. Would it be legal to restrict our children's use of the yard in such a way? At this choice I feel we have no choice but to hire an attorney, but from my past few weeks of online research, it actually appears that this is a legal form of age discrimination even if we lived here prior to the over 55 conversion. As a gambit end-run around this potential outcome, I deeded all of my children fractional shares in the condo so that they are now also property owners, but I fear the designation of all outside space as common areas places this out of my control and we're going to be at the mercy of a handful of grumpy old people who are perhaps tired of seeing and hearing our kids. Does anyone have any experience with anything like this? I mean I could totally understand if the community started as a retirement community but to have the rug swept out from under our feet like this with our childhood home feels terrible. It's exceptionally difficult to find any examples online of existing communities that have converted and then restricted families. Almost every post I've come across involves moving into an over-55 community. TLDR: Our 16-unit condo association is considering converting to over-55 and restricting our kids access to anything outside our home. Edited: Also wanted to mention that our condo association is situated in the middle of a much large sub-development with several hundred full sized homes, of which hundreds have children. We're directly across from a 100-unit apartment complex with no age restrictions and many kids. The entire other half of our street is duplex townhomes with kids in nearly every single one. Our condo association is just this tiny carveout with its own HOA in the middle of several square miles of homes."}]}

In no way are they severely autistic. Level 2 at most. I have client three. The new girl I’m working with needed to go the store so I say “take client three she’s easy you’ll be in and out.

I ask if she going to take her meds she says yes. We get to the living room and she starts cursing at me. I ask her to go to her room if she wants to yell and be angry. I remind her that client 1 is in a common space so it’s inappropriate for to be cursing and yell in front of her roommate. Next thing I know she in my face kicking me. She stops but before I can move away she is hitting me in the face. The only reason she stopped is because my coworker yelled at that she was calling the police. Immediately she starts crying and calling me crazy, a bitch, abusive etc. the manager shows up and she is on it with the excuses. The client states the following excuses -I attacked her because she triggered me -I attacked her because she has a family and I don’t(I went home with brain damage to an empty house. I don’t have family) -I don’t like her that’s why I beater her up That just what I remember because I sustained a brain injury that has ruined my life. I can’t work in healthcare anymore.

He also wouldnt let me lie down in the bed. At one point, he pulled my pants down and screamed `pull your fucking pants up and get back on the bed` I was entirely out of it. Everything was going black. I couldnt speak anymore and I saw a notebook in his lap so with my half-functioning brain, I tried to take it to write notes on or draw or anything but sit here on a bed in silence. I reached for the notebook and he slapped my hand and started yelling at me to stay away. The worst part for me though, was when my family wasnt allowed to see me for the 9 hours I was hospitalized. They asked me if it was okay to give my husband updates, and I said yes. But then every time he called `we have no patient here by that name`, he told me when he picked me up that he didnt even know I was alive until 5 am the next morning because, despite my wishes, they wouldnt let my family come to me. My husband and children didnt even know if I was alive or not for nearly 10 hours. This put all of them through unnecessary pain and fear. I had already told the doctors, `yes give them updates, they need updates` After about 8 or so hours they decided I didnt need a chaperone anymore, but they still left me and my family in the dark about most things. The part I'm focusing on, the `sexual assault` with him pulling my pants down. The cruelty of making me sit in one position for 9 hours, and the mishandling of information that should have gone to my husband and kids. Do I have any options here? Or do I just live with this?"}]}

Read the article, then steel-man two arguments -- one for and one against the thesis of the article. ARTICLE: The Army’s Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) recently announced it is planning to increase its space personnel and space control capabilities, despite the presence of the Space Force, created specifically to centralize resources and talent to maintain space superiority and provide those capabilities for the combatant commands to employ. The nation does not need the Army to duplicate those capabilities. In truth, the Army replicating Space Force operations within its service wastes precious resources, undermines jointness, and drives organizational fissures — all of which hinder America’s ability to fight and win. To date, there has been no pushback by the Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff or Congress on this bad idea. That should change, and those who should know better need to muster up the courage to halt these wasteful duplicative actions. The Army should be stopped, and all resources involved should be revectored to the Space Force. The 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act clarified the functions of the services and the combatant commands. The former provide capabilities by organizing, training and equipping forces to be apportioned to the latter for employment in military operations. Services do not fight wars, combatant commands do. Service capabilities are unique, and they exist to provide the means to master operations in their respective domains — air, sea, land, littorals and space. Jointness means combatant commands apportion unique capabilities from each of the services to best meet the requirements of a specific operation. It does not mean every service gets an equal share of the action regardless of real-world circumstances, and it does not mean each service replicates the functions of the others within its own ranks. To this end, the Air Force does not operate ships, and the Navy does not have tanks. The entire point of this alignment is to effectively and efficiently focus training, organization, and equipping in specific zones of excellence. That’s why Congress created the Space Force in 2019. The Army’s encroachment is clear — it is standing up an entirely new career field to conduct space operations instead of relying on the Space Force to deliver desired effects to the combatant commands. The stand up of the Space Force actually included the transfer of some soldiers and previous Army space missions to the new service. The Army’s new plan seeks to turn back the clock by regenerating organic space mission capabilities within the Army. Make no mistake — those new Army space capabilities will focus on Army missions, not joint operations, as clearly outlined in the recently published Army Space Vision. The Space Force has a FY24 budget of $30 billion while the US Army’s is $185.5 billion. The Space Force is organizing, training and equipping space forces for use in joint operations, while the Army is building space capabilities and capacity for use by the Army. Space is a joint domain, which every service relies on a limited pool of shared assets. Directing resources at this organic function at the expense of the joint construct undermines options available to combatant commanders, and makes it clear the Army never bought into the joint force operational construct. This latest move to usurp Space Force functions is only one of many recent examples where the Army is trying to obtain for itself the functions to conduct combat operations on its own. Deep attack is a mission of the Air Force, as is airborne ISR, but both are being usurped by the Army. And perhaps the most egregious move is the development and stand up of “multi-domain task forces.” Is that not the role and responsibility of the combatant commands? Should not the Secretary of Defense insist on the services staying in their domain-focused lanes of responsibility? With respect to the Space Force, the current budget reflects that it already has too few resources given the expansive nature of its mission demands and America’s newest service is expected to take a 3.3 percent cut in FY26. Congressional budget caps make the fiscal situation even more dire. The idea the Army would apportion money for space assets just for its own use, as opposed to that money going to the service created to give the Army and all its sister services those capabilities, is ludicrous. Great Power Competition requires actual jointness: using the right capabilities regardless of service origin at the right places and right times to achieve a combatant commander’s objectives. The nation cannot afford each service duplicating other service roles, responsibilities, and missions and in doing so, wasting precious resources. In a time of inflation, constrained budgets, and budget caps, it is fiscally irresponsible and operationally dangerous to allow the Army to continue its encroachment of Space Force missions. Ignoring the tenets of joint operations leads to a waste of taxpayer dollars and risks unnecessarily complicating combatant command functions. The Secretary of Defense should intervene by directing the Army to halt duplication of Space Force functions, and taking budget action to eliminate any Army funding for functions that are performed by the Space Force — the service created specifically to execute space operations.

This vascular architecture closely mimics that of naturally occurring blood vessels and represents significant progress toward being able to manufacture implantable human organs. The achievement is published in Advanced Materials. “In prior work, we developed a new 3D bioprinting method, known as ‘sacrificial writing in functional tissue’ (SWIFT), for patterning hollow channels within a living cellular matrix. Here, building on this method, we introduce coaxial SWIFT (co-SWIFT) that recapitulates the multilayer architecture found in native blood vessels, making it easier to form an interconnected endothelium and more robust to withstand the internal pressure of blood flow,” said first author Paul Stankey, a bioengineering Ph.D. student at SEAS in the lab of co-senior author Jennifer Lewis, Hansjorg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at SEAS Wyss Core Faculty member. The key innovation developed by the team was a unique core-shell nozzle with two independently controllable fluid channels for the “inks” that make up the printed vessels: a collagen-based shell ink and a gelatin-based core ink. The interior core chamber of the nozzle extends slightly beyond the shell chamber so that the nozzle can fully puncture a previously printed vessel to create interconnected branching networks for sufficient oxygenation of human tissues and organs via perfusion. The size of the vessels can be varied during printing by changing either the printing speed or the ink flow rates. Will this innovation lead to a reduction in health-care costs and an increase in human healthspan? Steel-man the argument for both sides of the question."}]}

After the sale of condo, I moved back in with my parents with the expectation of buying something else within a month. House hunting was an absolute nightmare. Finally found the `right` home for me in early- June and started all the paperwork. Was set to close TODAY but found out last Friday at the very last minute from the mortgage lender that when the IRS check came back it was found that I owe about $49k in Federal taxes! I knew I owed a little from last year but had no idea it was this high. Some of this dates back to 2018! I doubled check with accountant. Owe another $10k to the state. Then the next day, my Dad unexpectedly passed away! I'm still living at home with Mom and now it is uncertain what she will do with their house. I am assuming she with move out of state with one of my siblings in the future, but it is unknown at the time. I expressed interest in buying the house from her if it came to it. Current income is about $3k a week. That will drop to $1k a week come October 1st and winter is unknown. I realize buying a house is probably out of the picture until this tax stuff is taken care of. Both the mortgage lender and accountant recommended at least getting on a payment plan for the money owed from last year. Should I pay the taxes off in full with cash in the savings account that was meant for a house? Basically means I have to start over with savings and could be another year or two before I hit that number in there again."}]}

The rest are like no interest payment plans for some furniture, a phone, a computer for someone I'm a co-owner on the card with, so my actual bad debt is closer to 10k. I received a letter in the mail from Lendvia and after speaking with a rep I was offered a payment plan to repay everything without massive interest. It's not a consolidation loan but rather I'm told that they have agreements with creditors where they can take payments from me and make them on my behalf over a period of time. They claim they can reduce my total owed balance while also not charging me interest, as they have people who negotiate tons of debt with creditors and I'm just one piece of a bigger pie. Naturally seems pretty good, too good honestly, so I asked the rep what the catch was. In addition to their own fees already rolled into the main principal balance I'm also expected to not use the cards which means they'll eventually be closed for inactivity. I'm told this is preferable to the alternatives as I'll be able to re-establish a relationship with them without much fuss in the future. It still just seems too good to be true so I'm asking people a little more financially savvy than me. Is this place trustworthy? Does it really work like this? I'm really not attached to two rewards cards so I really don't mind losing the cards in question. Would it just be better to call the individual creditors and work out a hardship deal with them for repayment since it's only two cards and not my entire credit portfolio? With the current interest rates I'm going to be paying thousand of dollars in interest on the debt and a short term credit hit seems better than long term throwing money into a void."}]}

My mom knows her more than I do so she’s telling her to send over all the copies of pge bill being paid in full, still waiting for that at the moment.

Getting her kids something such as food, stepping away from computer, Answering questions from her kids, Breaking up sibling fights. I don't know if she has childcare options such as via a nanny or from family members. She lives in what is considered a rural state so I understand childcare options may be limited. Should I be giving her feedback as to how she seems distracted? Focus during meetings along with professional behavior is important, and I don't want to be giving other team members the perception that I am giving her special treatment by turning a blind eye. How can I talk to her without prying into her personal life or seeming discriminatory?"}]}

Admittedly the team itself is slightly larger than it should be but I have seen over the past few months that those in India (developers and testers by trade) struggle with the Scrum mindset. They take no initiative and speak very little in the various events. When it comes to work, they are slow and wait to be told how to do something (even though they are all senior developers) and almost down tools at the first sign of an impediment (with no mindset to then help others) On refinement sessions, they leave everything to the non Indian members to ask and query. When raising this with the development manager, he quotes from the Scrum playbook that the team is self-empowered and the issues should be raised in the retrospective and dealt with by the team. I may be in the position where I am just unlucky with the quality of the team but how do other co-located teams deal with this situation? Everything I read about Scrum and offshore talks about completely offshore located teams (Indian PO and Scrum master) rather than an almost implied hierarchy with onshore, nearshore AND offshore. No matter how much we tell them there is no hierarchy and all view and opinions are equal, they are simply not buying into it or performing."}]}

How can I handle such to avoid payee confrontation/complication in the future? Example, yearly rate is 45,000 and appears on the offer letter as such, along with a calculated hourly rate. The payroll software, when a 45,000 yearly salary is input computes a slightly different hourly rate. Thus both systems calculate a slightly different total yearly salary when the successive hourly rates are used to calculate. This has caused employees, in some cases, to inquire as to where their penny is. How do organizations typically alleviate the difference in calculation issue? Any suggestions?"}]}

All they talk about is gossip or bad-mouthing the bosses. The bad-mouthing often turns out to be false later on, like a few days or weeks later. I don't like their gossip because they tend to be slanderous towards former colleagues or condescending towards their targets. I'm more of a discreet person. I only engage in conversations when I know it's something interesting or where others can learn something; otherwise, I keep my thoughts to myself. Initially, I tried to be part of the team. However, as time passed and I stopped taking breaks with them, they started excluding me from discussions. For example, they created a Slack channel to chat among themselves without including me. When I had to take a break due to a health problem, nobody asked how I felt when I returned, nor did anyone inquire about what happened. As a result, I've isolated myself. This isolation leads me into a negative loop where I feel like I'm not part of the team, and they respond by looking at me angrily or giving me cold silences when I enter a room. I need to stay in this job due to financial difficulties, but I'm actively looking for another job. In the meantime, how should I behave? Should I continue trying to fit in with them, even though it drains me and might not be sustainable, just for a slightly better environment? Or should I focus solely on my job and wait for another opportunity? Is there something else I haven't considered? I appreciate any insights you might have."}]}

I've been here a long time, and have a good overview of what everybody did, so I have now noticed that many tasks are simply not being done.

I understand that sometimes management have to make tough decisions, but then they should also address the consequences of those decisions appropriately. This, they have not done at all. So, what is the correct behavior in this instance?"}]}
